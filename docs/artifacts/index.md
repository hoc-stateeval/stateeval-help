# Working with Artifacts

Artifacts are documents, files, and links that serve as evidence for evaluations. Both evaluatees and evaluators can submit artifacts, each managing their own collection.

## What Makes a Good Artifact?

Artifacts should demonstrate professional practice. Common examples:

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Planning** | Lesson plans, unit plans, curriculum maps |
| **Student Work** | Samples showing student learning, assessment results |
| **Professional Growth** | PD certificates, conference notes, collaboration documentation |
| **Communication** | Parent newsletters, meeting agendas, team communications |
| **Reflection** | Goal progress documentation, self-evaluation notes |

:::tip Quality Over Quantity
A few well-documented artifacts with clear context are more valuable than many artifacts with no explanation. Always explain what the evidence shows and why it matters.

## How Artifacts Work

Each party manages their own artifacts:

| Who | What They Can Do |
|-----|------------------|
| **Evaluatee** | Create, edit, share, delete their own artifacts |
| **Evaluator** | Create, edit, share, delete their own artifacts; view evaluatee's shared artifacts |

### Workflow

Artifacts follow a simple workflow:

1. **Draft** - Private to creator, can be edited
2. **Shared** - Visible to both parties, can still be updated and re-shared
3. **Deleted** - Removed (can delete from Draft or Shared)

Unlike observations or evaluations, artifacts **can be updated after sharing**. If you update a shared artifact, re-share to push the changes.

See [Artifact Workflow](../reference/workflows#detailed-workflows) for the complete workflow diagram.

## Best Practices

**For Evaluatees:**
- Submit artifacts throughout the year, not just at the end
- Link artifacts to specific evaluation criteria/components
- Add context explaining what the artifact demonstrates
- Include reflection on student impact or professional growth

**For Evaluators:**
- Review artifacts regularly, not just at evaluation time
- Add notes to acknowledge artifacts (visible to evaluatee)
- Consider artifacts alongside observations when scoring
- Your own artifacts can document evidence you've gathered

## Plan Type Sync

If an evaluatee's plan type changes (Comprehensive ↔ Focused), artifacts can optionally update automatically. This depends on the "Keep Artifact Plan Type in Sync" setting. See [Artifact Settings](../reference/modules-settings#artifacts-module-settings).
