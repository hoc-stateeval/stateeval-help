# Working with Artifacts

Artifacts are documents, files, and links that serve as evidence for evaluations. Both evaluatees and evaluators can create and share artifacts, following the same process.

## What Makes a Good Artifact?

Artifacts should demonstrate professional practice. Common examples:

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Planning** | Lesson plans, unit plans, curriculum maps |
| **Student Work** | Samples showing student learning, assessment results |
| **Professional Growth** | PD certificates, conference notes, collaboration documentation |
| **Communication** | Parent newsletters, meeting agendas, team communications |
| **Reflection** | Goal progress documentation, self-evaluation notes |

:::tip Quality Over Quantity
A few well-documented artifacts with clear context are more valuable than many artifacts with no explanation. Always explain what the evidence shows and why it matters.

## Creating and Sharing Artifacts

Both evaluatees and evaluators follow the same process:

1. **Create** an artifact in Draft state (private to you)
2. **Add content** — files, links, narrative description
3. **Align** to rubric components (each alignment becomes a separate evidence item)
4. **Share** when ready — the artifact and its alignments become visible to the other party

### Workflow States

| State | What You Can Do |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Draft** | Edit, align to rubric, share, or delete |
| **Shared** | View, unlock to make revisions, or delete |

### Making Revisions

To update a shared artifact:
1. **Unlock** the artifact (returns to Draft)
2. Make your changes
3. **Re-share** to publish the updated version

You can unlock your own artifacts directly — no approval needed from the other party.

See [Workflows](../reference/workflows.md#creator-managed-evidence-collections) for the complete workflow details.

## How Artifact Evidence Appears

When you share an artifact, each rubric component alignment becomes a separate evidence item. These evidence items appear in:

- **YTD Evidence** — Aggregated with all other published evidence
- **Summative Evidence** — Filtered to the plan type scope

If you aligned an artifact to multiple rubric components, each alignment shows up as its own evidence item in the collected evidence for that component.

## Embedded vs. Global Artifacts

| Type | Created In | Evidence Appears In |
|------|------------|---------------------|
| **Global** | Artifacts work area | YTD and Summative when shared |
| **Embedded** | Within an observation, coded note, etc. | The parent evidence collection |

Embedded artifacts must be shared before the parent evidence collection is submitted, or they won't be included in the published evidence.

## Best Practices

**For Evaluatees:**
- Submit artifacts throughout the year, not just at the end
- Align artifacts to specific rubric components
- Add context explaining what the artifact demonstrates
- Include reflection on student impact or professional growth

**For Evaluators:**
- Review shared artifacts regularly, not just at evaluation time
- Your own artifacts can document evidence you've gathered
- Consider artifacts alongside observations when scoring
