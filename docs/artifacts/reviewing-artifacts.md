# Reviewing Artifacts

As an evaluator, you review artifacts submitted by your evaluatees.

## Accessing Artifacts

1. Go to your evaluator dashboard
2. Select an evaluatee
3. Click **Artifacts**

## Reviewing an Artifact

For each artifact, you can:
- View the submitted file(s) or link
- Read the evaluatee's description and reflection
- See which criteria/components it's linked to
- Add evaluator notes (visible to the evaluatee)

## Adding Evaluator Notes

1. Open the artifact
2. Click **Add Note** or find the notes section
3. Enter your feedback
4. Save

Your notes become part of the evaluation record and are visible to the evaluatee.

## Using Artifacts in Evaluation

Artifacts contribute to the overall evaluation by:
- Providing evidence of practice
- Supporting component ratings
- Demonstrating growth over time

Consider artifacts alongside observations and other evidence when completing evaluations.
