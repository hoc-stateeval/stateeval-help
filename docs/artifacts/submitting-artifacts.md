# Submitting Artifacts

As an evaluatee, you submit artifacts to demonstrate your professional practice.

## What is an Artifact?

An artifact is any piece of evidence that supports your evaluation, such as:
- Lesson plans
- Student work samples
- Professional development certificates
- Parent communication
- Assessment data

## How to Submit an Artifact

1. Go to **My Evaluation** > **Artifacts**
2. Click **Add Artifact**
3. Enter a title and description
4. Upload your file(s) or add a link
5. Select the criteria/components this artifact relates to
6. Add any reflection or context
7. Click **Submit**

## Best Practices

- **Be descriptive** - Explain what the artifact shows and why it's relevant
- **Link to criteria** - Connect artifacts to specific evaluation components
- **Add context** - Include reflection on what you learned or how students benefited
- **Submit throughout the year** - Don't wait until the end; add artifacts as you create them
