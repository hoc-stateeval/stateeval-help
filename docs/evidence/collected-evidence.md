# Collected Evidence

The Collected Evidence section shows all evidence items aligned to the currently selected rubric component. This is where you review evidence before packaging it or assigning scores.

## What You See

Each evidence item displays:
- **Type** — Where the evidence came from (e.g., Observation Notes, Artifact, Conference Response)
- **Created** — When it was created
- **Created by** — Who created it
- **Connected to** — The source evidence collection
- **Content** — The evidence text (expandable for longer items)

## Evidence Types

Evidence comes from various activities throughout the evaluation:

| Source | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| **Observations** | Observation notes, pre/post-conference responses, conference summaries |
| **Artifacts** | Documents, files, links, narrative descriptions |
| **Coded Notes** | Informal evaluator notes from walkthroughs or conversations |
| **Student Growth** | Goal text, achievement data, prompt responses |
| **Rubric Notes** | Narrative text added directly in Evidence View |
| **Summative** | Reflection prompt responses |

:::tip How Evidence Gets Created
Evidence can be created by [coding text](./text-coding.md) directly in observation notes or conference responses, by aligning artifacts to rubric components, or by adding [rubric notes](./rubric-notes.md).

## Managing Evidence

### Show/Hide Controls
- **Show Evidence** toggle — Turn off to hide the evidence list and focus on rubric alignment or packages
- **Hide Already Packaged** checkbox — Hide evidence that's already in a package, helping you focus on what still needs attention

### Deleting Evidence
You can delete evidence items you created, as long as:
- The evidence collection is still editable (not locked)
- The item isn't included in an evidence package (shown with a lock icon)

:::note
Only the author of an evidence item can delete it. If another evaluator created the evidence, you won't see a delete option.

## Selecting Evidence for Packages

Click on evidence items to select them for packaging. Selected items show an **Unselect** button. Once you've selected the items you want to group together, you can create an evidence package.

See [Evidence Packages](./evidence-packages.md) for the full packaging workflow.
