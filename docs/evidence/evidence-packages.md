# Evidence Packages

An evidence package groups one or more collected evidence items together and aligns them to specific rubric performance level text. Packages are a key part of building a strong evaluation record, connecting your evidence directly to the rubric.

## Why Package Evidence?

While collected evidence shows that evidence exists for a rubric component, an evidence package goes further by:

- **Grouping related evidence** - Combining multiple pieces of evidence that together support a claim
- **Aligning to rubric text** - Selecting specific descriptor text from a performance level to show exactly what the evidence demonstrates
- **Supporting scoring** - Providing a clear, documented connection between evidence and performance levels

## Where Packages Can Be Created

| Evidence Collection | Can Create Packages |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Observations | Yes |
| Self-Assessments | Yes |
| Coded Notes | Yes |
| Student Growth | Yes |
| YTD Evidence | Yes |
| Summative Evaluation | No |

## Creating an Evidence Package

### Step 1: Select Evidence Items

In the Collected Evidence section, click on one or more evidence items to select them. Each selected item shows an **Unselect** button and is visually highlighted. The **Evidence Package Creation** panel appears on the right side, listing the items you've selected.

You can remove an item from the selection by clicking the remove icon next to it in the Evidence Package Creation panel, or by clicking **Unselect** on the evidence item itself.

### Step 2: Select Rubric Text

Click **Go to Rubric** in the Evidence Package Creation panel. Then highlight a contiguous selection of text from one of the four performance level descriptors (UNS, BAS, PRO, DIS) in the Rubric Alignment section.

The selected text and its performance level will appear in the "Relevant Rubric Alignment" section of the Evidence Package Creation panel.

**Rules for text selection:**
- You can only select text from a **single** performance level descriptor
- The selection must be **contiguous** (one unbroken highlight)
- If Critical Attributes are enabled and not reference-only, you can also select text from the Critical Attributes section

:::tip
To replace a text selection, first remove the current selection using the delete icon, then highlight new text from the rubric.

### Step 3: Create the Package

Click **Create** to finalize the evidence package. The package appears in the **Packaged Evidence** section below the Rubric Alignment area.

## What a Package Looks Like

A created evidence package displays:

- **Source** - Where the package was created (e.g., "Year to Date" or the observation title)
- **Created** - The date the package was created
- **Rubric Statement** - The performance level letter and the selected rubric descriptor text
- **Evidence Items** - Each evidence item included in the package, with its type, date, author, and content

## Managing Evidence Packages

### Adding a General Note

After creating a package, you can add a **General Note** to provide additional context or explanation. Click **Edit** on the package, enter your note in the "General Note" text area, and click **Done**.

### Editing a Package

Click the **Edit** button on an existing package to:
- Add or update the General Note
- View the package details

### Deleting a Package

Click the **Delete** button to remove an evidence package. This removes the package but does **not** delete the underlying evidence items - they remain in the Collected Evidence section and can be used in new packages.

### Removing Evidence Items from a Package

Within an evidence package, each evidence item has a remove icon. Clicking it removes that item from the package. If all items are removed, the package itself is deleted.

## Effects on Evidence Items

When an evidence item is included in an evidence package:

- The item shows a **locked** icon in the Collected Evidence section (instead of the delete icon)
- The item cannot be deleted until it is removed from all evidence packages
- The "Hide evidence you have already included in packages" checkbox can hide these items from the Collected Evidence list

## Evidence Packages and Scoring

Evidence packages contribute to the evidence counts shown in the Rubric Navigator. The **Packaged** column in the Evidence tab counts individual evidence items across all packages for each rubric component.

In the Performance tab, the performance level aligned to each package contributes to the per-level evidence count tallies.

## Including Packages in Reports

In the Summative Evaluation, evidence packages can be marked for inclusion in the final report using the **Include in Report?** checkbox. The Report tab in the Rubric Navigator shows counts that reflect only the included items.
