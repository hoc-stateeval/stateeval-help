# Evidence Packages

An evidence package groups evidence items together and aligns them to specific rubric text. Packages are how you document the connection between your evidence and the evaluation rubric.

## Why Package Evidence?

While collected evidence shows that evidence *exists* for a rubric component, a package goes further:

- **Groups related evidence** — Combine multiple pieces that together support a claim
- **Aligns to rubric text** — Select the specific descriptor text your evidence demonstrates
- **Supports scoring** — Document why a particular performance level is supported

:::tip
You don't have to package all evidence. Focus on packaging the evidence that most clearly supports performance level determinations.

## Creating a Package

### Step 1: Select Evidence Items
In the Collected Evidence section, click on one or more evidence items. Each selected item shows an **Unselect** button. The Evidence Package Creation panel appears, listing your selections.

### Step 2: Select Rubric Text
Click **Go to Rubric**, then highlight text from one of the performance level descriptors. The selected text appears in the package creation panel.

### Step 3: Create
Click **Create** to finalize the package. It appears in the Packaged Evidence section below the rubric alignment.

## What a Package Shows

A created package displays:
- **Source** — Where the package was created
- **Rubric Statement** — The performance level and selected rubric text
- **Evidence Items** — Each item in the package with its type, date, and content

## Managing Packages

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| **Add a note** | Click Edit, add a General Note for context |
| **Remove an item** | Click the remove icon on the item within the package |
| **Delete the package** | Click Delete (doesn't delete the underlying evidence) |

## Where Packages Can Be Created

| Evidence Collection | Can Create Packages |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Observations | Yes |
| Coded Notes | Yes |
| Student Growth | Yes |
| Self-Assessment | Yes |
| YTD Evidence | Yes |
| Summative Evaluation | No (view only) |

## Effects on Evidence Items

When an evidence item is in a package:
- It shows a **lock icon** instead of delete
- It can't be deleted until removed from all packages
- The **Hide Already Packaged** checkbox can hide it from the Collected Evidence list

## Including Packages in Reports

In the Summative Evaluation, each package has an **Include in Report?** checkbox. Only packages you check will appear in the final summative report. The Report tab in the Rubric Navigator shows counts for included items only.
