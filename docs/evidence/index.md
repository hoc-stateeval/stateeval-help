# Evidence View

The Evidence View is where evidence meets the evaluation rubric. It's a two-pane workspace that lets you review collected evidence, align it to rubric components, and (in some cases) assign scores.

## Why Evidence View Matters

Throughout the evaluation year, evidence is collected through various activities — observations, artifacts, student growth goals, and more. The Evidence View is where you make sense of that evidence by:

- **Seeing what's been collected** for each rubric component
- **Packaging evidence** to connect it to specific rubric performance level text
- **Reviewing the rubric** to understand what each performance level looks like
- **Scoring** (when enabled) to assign performance levels to rubric components

## The Two-Pane Layout

| Left Pane | Right Pane |
|-----------|------------|
| Details for the selected rubric component | [Rubric Navigator](./rubric-navigator.md) |
| Collected evidence items | Browse and select rubric components |
| Rubric alignment text | See evidence counts and scores |
| Evidence packages | Navigate the framework |

**How it works:** Select a rubric component in the Rubric Navigator (right), and the left pane shows everything related to that component — evidence, rubric text, packages, and scoring controls.

## Where You'll Find Evidence View

The Evidence View tab appears in most evidence collections:

| Evidence Collection | Evidence View | Notes |
|--------------------|---------------|-------|
| Observations | Yes | Review and package observation evidence |
| Coded Notes | Yes | Review and package coded note evidence |
| Student Growth | Yes | For goal setting and achievement |
| Self-Assessment | Yes | For reflection purposes (doesn't flow to summative) |
| YTD Evidence | Yes | Aggregated view of all published evidence |
| Summative Evaluation | Yes | Read-only evidence; used for final scoring |

:::info Evidence View vs. Evidence Collection
Don't confuse the **Evidence View** (a tab within various evidence collections) with **Evidence Collections** (the containers like Observations, Artifacts, etc.). The Evidence View is the workspace; evidence collections are the sources of evidence.

## Common Tasks

### Reviewing Evidence
1. Select a rubric component in the Rubric Navigator
2. Review the [collected evidence](./collected-evidence.md) aligned to that component
3. Use filters to focus on specific evidence types

### Packaging Evidence
1. Select evidence items to group together
2. Choose rubric text that the evidence supports
3. Create the package to document the connection

See [Evidence Packages](./evidence-packages.md) for details.

### Adding Notes
Need to add narrative evidence directly? Use [Rubric Notes](./rubric-notes.md) to add text evidence aligned to the current rubric component.
