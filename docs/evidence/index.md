# Evidence View

The Evidence View is a two-pane workspace where you review, organize, and package evidence aligned to evaluation rubric components. It appears as a tab within several evidence collections, including Observations, Self-Assessments, Coded Notes, Student Growth, YTD Evidence, and the Summative Evaluation.

## Layout

The Evidence View is divided into two panes:

| Left Pane | Right Pane |
|-----------|------------|
| Active rubric element title and score buttons | [Rubric Navigator](./rubric-navigator) |
| [Collected Evidence](./collected-evidence) | |
| [Rubric Notes](./rubric-notes) (Add Rubric Note) | |
| [Rubric Alignment](./rubric-alignment) | |
| [Evidence Packages](./evidence-packages) | |

### Left Pane

The left pane displays details for the currently selected rubric component. At the top is the rubric component title along with performance level score buttons (UNS, BAS, PRO, DIS). Below that, you'll find:

- **Collected Evidence** - All evidence items aligned to this rubric component
- **Add Rubric Note** - A button to add narrative text evidence (when available)
- **Rubric Alignment** - The full rubric text for all four performance levels
- **Evidence Packages** - Any evidence packages you've created for this component

### Right Pane

The right pane contains the **Rubric Navigator**, which lets you browse the evaluation framework and select different rubric components. It has multiple view tabs (Evidence, Performance, and in some cases Report) and shows evidence counts and scores at a glance.

## Where the Evidence View Appears

The Evidence View is available in these evidence collections:

| Evidence Collection | Evidence View | Notes |
|--------------------|---------------|-------|
| Observations | Yes | Accessed via the "Evidence View" tab |
| Self-Assessments | Yes | |
| Coded Notes | Yes | |
| Student Growth | Yes | Goal Setting and Achievement phases |
| YTD Evidence | Yes | Aggregated view across all collections |
| Summative Evaluation | Yes | Read-only for most evidence; used for final scoring |

## Typical Workflow

A typical workflow in the Evidence View:

1. **Select a rubric component** in the Rubric Navigator (right pane)
2. **Review collected evidence** for that component (left pane)
3. **Add rubric notes** if you need to add narrative evidence
4. **Create evidence packages** by selecting evidence items and aligning them to rubric performance level text
5. **Score the component** (if scoring is enabled for this evidence collection)
6. **Navigate** to the next rubric component and repeat

Use the Rubric Navigator's evidence counts to quickly identify which rubric components have evidence and which still need attention.
