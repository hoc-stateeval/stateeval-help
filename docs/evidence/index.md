# Evidence View

The Evidence View is where evidence meets the evaluation rubric. It's a two-pane workspace that lets you review collected evidence, align it to rubric components, and (in some cases) assign scores.

## Why Evidence View Matters

Throughout the evaluation year, evidence is collected through various activities — observations, artifacts, student growth goals, and more. The Evidence View is where you make sense of that evidence by:

- **Seeing what's been collected** for each rubric component
- **Packaging evidence** to connect it to specific rubric performance level text
- **Reviewing the rubric** to understand what each performance level looks like
- **Scoring** (when enabled) to assign performance levels to rubric components

## The Two-Pane Layout

The Evidence View has two panes that work together:

- **Left pane** — Shows details for the selected rubric component: collected evidence, rubric text, evidence packages, and scoring controls
- **Right pane** — The [Rubric Navigator](./rubric-navigator.md), which lets you move around the rubric to view evidence and scores for different components and criteria. It also shows evidence counts aggregated within each criterion and performance scores across the rubric at a glance.

Select a rubric component in the Rubric Navigator, and the left pane updates to show everything for that component.

## Where You'll Find Evidence View

Every evidence collection except Artifacts has an Evidence View tab. The Evidence View always shows an aggregated view of the evidence within that collection.

| Evidence Collection | What the Evidence View Shows |
|--------------------|------------------------------|
| Observations | Evidence from that observation (notes, conference responses, embedded artifacts) |
| Coded Notes | Evidence from that coded note |
| Student Growth | Evidence from goal setting or achievement |
| Self-Assessment | Evidence from that self-assessment (for reflection; doesn't flow to summative) |
| YTD Evidence | Aggregated view of all published evidence across the rubric |
| Summative Evaluation | Aggregated view of all published evidence scoped to the plan type |

### Why No Evidence View for Artifacts?

Artifacts work differently. When you create an artifact, you align it to one or more rubric components. Each alignment becomes a separate evidence item that appears in:
- **YTD and Summative** — when the artifact is shared (global artifacts)
- **The parent evidence collection** — when the artifact is embedded within an observation, coded note, etc.

## Common Tasks

### Reviewing Evidence
1. Select a rubric component in the Rubric Navigator
2. Review the [collected evidence](./collected-evidence.md) aligned to that component
3. Use filters to focus on specific evidence types

### Packaging Evidence
1. Select evidence items to group together
2. Choose rubric text that the evidence supports
3. Create the package to document the connection

See [Evidence Packages](./evidence-packages.md) for details.

### Adding Notes
Need to add narrative evidence directly? Use [Rubric Notes](./rubric-notes.md) to add text evidence aligned to the current rubric component.
