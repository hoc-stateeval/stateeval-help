# Rubric Alignment

The Rubric Alignment section displays the performance level descriptors for the selected rubric component. This is the rubric text that defines what Unsatisfactory, Basic, Proficient, and Distinguished practice looks like.

## Performance Levels

All Washington State evaluation frameworks use four performance levels:

| Level | Abbreviation | Meaning |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Unsatisfactory** | UNS | Does not meet the standard |
| **Basic** | BAS | Approaching the standard |
| **Proficient** | PRO | Meets the standard |
| **Distinguished** | DIS | Exceeds the standard |

The rubric alignment shows the descriptor text for each level side by side, making it easy to compare what practice looks like across the continuum.

## Selecting Rubric Text for Packages

When creating an evidence package, you can highlight text from a performance level descriptor. This connects your evidence to a specific aspect of the rubric.

**Rules for text selection:**
- Select from only **one** performance level
- The selection must be **contiguous** (one unbroken highlight)
- Click **Go to Rubric** in the package creation panel, then highlight your text

See [Evidence Packages](./evidence-packages.md) for the full packaging workflow.

## Highlighted Text

When evidence packages have been created, the corresponding rubric text is highlighted. This shows which parts of the rubric have been addressed by packaged evidence.

## Critical Attributes (Danielson Framework)

If your district uses the Danielson framework, you may see **Critical Attributes** below the standard performance level descriptors.

- **Show Critical Attributes** toggle — Expand to see the critical attributes for each performance level
- Critical attributes can be selected for evidence packages (unless your district has set them as reference-only)

:::note
Critical Attributes are specific to the Danielson framework. Other frameworks (Marzano, CEL 5D+, etc.) don't include this section.
