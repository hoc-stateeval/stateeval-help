# Rubric Navigator

The Rubric Navigator is the right pane of the Evidence View. It displays your evaluation framework's criteria and rubric components, letting you select components and see evidence counts at a glance.

## Navigator Tabs

The Rubric Navigator has tabs that show different views of your evidence:

| Tab | What It Shows | Available In |
|-----|---------------|--------------|
| **Evidence** | Evidence counts (collected items and packages) | All evidence collections |
| **Performance** | Assigned scores and evidence by performance level | All evidence collections |
| **Report** | Evidence marked for inclusion in the final report | Summative only |

### Evidence Tab

Shows two counts for each rubric component:
- **Collected** — Number of evidence items aligned to the component
- **Packaged** — Number of evidence packages created

Use the **Evidence Only** checkbox to hide components with no evidence, helping you focus on what's been documented.

### Performance Tab

Shows scoring information:
- **Score indicator** (U, B, P, D) with the assigned score highlighted
- **Evidence counts by performance level** — how many evidence items support each level

This helps you see where your evidence is strongest and how it aligns with potential scores.

### Report Tab

Available only in the Summative Evaluation. Shows counts for evidence and packages marked for inclusion in the final summative report.

## Navigating the Rubric

### Selecting a Component
Click any rubric component row to select it. The left pane updates to show:
- Collected evidence for that component
- Rubric alignment text
- Evidence packages
- Scoring controls (if enabled)

### Expanding and Collapsing
Click the +/- toggle on criteria rows to expand or collapse the rubric components within that criterion.

## Framework Display

What you see in the Rubric Navigator depends on your plan type:

| Plan Type | What's Displayed |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Comprehensive** | All criteria (C1-C8) and student growth components |
| **Focused** | Focus criterion, student growth components |
| **YTD Evidence** | Always shows the full framework, regardless of plan type |

:::note Framework Views
Your district chooses an instructional framework (like Danielson or Marzano) that maps to the state's eight criteria. You can switch between state framework view (C1-C8) and instructional framework view using the dropdown in the top navigation.

## Scoring

When scoring is enabled, performance level buttons (UNS, BAS, PRO, DIS) appear at the top of the left pane. Click a button to assign that score to the selected rubric component.

Whether scoring is available depends on the evidence collection and your district's settings. Scoring is always required in the Summative Evaluation for the criteria being evaluated.

:::tip Evidence Counts Help
Use the evidence counts in the Rubric Navigator to identify which rubric components have strong evidence support and which might need more attention.
