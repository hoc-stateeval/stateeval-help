# Rubric Notes

A Rubric Note is narrative text evidence you add directly in the Evidence View, aligned to the selected rubric component. It's a quick way to document observations or reflections without creating a formal artifact.

## Adding a Rubric Note

1. Select a rubric component in the Rubric Navigator
2. Click **Add Rubric Note**
3. Type your narrative evidence
4. Click **Done** to save

The rubric note appears immediately in the Collected Evidence list, aligned to the selected component.

## When to Use Rubric Notes

Rubric Notes are useful for:
- Quick observations that don't warrant a full artifact
- Brief reflections on practice
- Notes from informal conversations or walkthroughs
- Supplementary context for other evidence

:::tip
Be specific about what you observed and how it relates to the rubric component. Rubric Notes can be included in evidence packages just like any other evidence item.

## Managing Rubric Notes

Once created, a Rubric Note is like any other evidence item. You can:

- Delete it (if you're the author and it's not in a package)

If the note is in an evidence package, it shows a lock icon. Remove it from the package first if you need to delete it.
