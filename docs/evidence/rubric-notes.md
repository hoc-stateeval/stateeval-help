# Rubric Notes

A Rubric Note is narrative text evidence that you add directly in the Evidence View, aligned to the currently selected rubric component. This is a quick way to document observations, reflections, or other evidence without creating a formal artifact.

## Adding a Rubric Note

1. Select a rubric component in the Rubric Navigator
2. Click the **Add Rubric Note** button in the Collected Evidence section
3. A text input area appears - type your narrative evidence
4. Click **Done** to save, or **Cancel** to discard

The rubric note is immediately created as an evidence item aligned to the selected rubric component and appears in the Collected Evidence list.

## Where Rubric Notes Are Available

Rubric Notes can be added in the following evidence collections:

| Evidence Collection | Available | Notes |
|--------------------|-----------|-------|
| Observations | Always | |
| Self-Assessments | Always | |
| Coded Notes | Always | |
| Student Growth | Always | |
| YTD Evidence | Depends on district settings | Controlled by district YTD Evidence module settings for evaluator and evaluatee |
| Summative Evaluation | Never | |

:::info District Settings for YTD Evidence
Whether you can add Rubric Notes in the YTD Evidence collection depends on your district's configuration. Your district administrator controls this through the YTD Evidence module settings, with separate settings for evaluators and evaluatees.

## Managing Rubric Notes

Once created, a Rubric Note appears as a regular evidence item in the Collected Evidence section with:

- **Type:** Rubric Note
- **Created:** The date you added it
- **Created by:** Your name
- **Connected to:** The evidence collection where you created it
- **Content:** The narrative text you entered

You can **delete** a Rubric Note as long as:
- You are the author
- The evidence collection is still editable
- The note is not included in an evidence package

If the note has been included in an evidence package, it will show a locked icon instead. You must first remove it from the evidence package before you can delete it.

## Tips

- Use Rubric Notes to capture quick observations or reflections that don't warrant a full artifact
- Be specific about what you observed and how it relates to the rubric component
- Rubric Notes can be included in evidence packages just like any other evidence item
