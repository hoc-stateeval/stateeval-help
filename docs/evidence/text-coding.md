# Coding Text as Evidence

Text coding lets you turn specific passages of text into evidence by aligning them to rubric components. Instead of adding separate notes, you highlight meaningful text directly where it appears and connect it to the rubric.

## Why Code Text?

When writing observation notes or reviewing conference responses, you may notice passages that demonstrate specific rubric components. Text coding lets you:

- **Highlight the evidence inline** — Mark the exact words that support your observation
- **Align to rubric components** — Connect the passage to a specific component (e.g., 4c)
- **Create evidence automatically** — Coded text becomes an evidence item for that component

## Where Text Coding Works

| Text Source | Who Can Code It |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Observation notes | Evaluator (while writing) |
| Conference summary notes | Evaluator (while writing) |
| Evaluatee conference responses | Evaluator (using coding editor) |
| Summative reflections | Evaluator (using coding editor) |

## The Rubric Toolbar

When editing your own text (like observation notes), you'll see a toolbar with rubric component buttons — organized by domain (D1, D2, D3, D4) with individual components listed (1a, 1b, 1c, etc.).

## How to Code Text

### Coding Your Own Text (Evaluator)

1. Write or edit your text in the editor
2. **Select** the passage you want to code
3. **Click** the rubric component button in the toolbar
4. The text is highlighted and marked with the component code

The coded text now appears as an evidence item for that component in the Evidence View.

### Coding Evaluatee Text

For text entered by the evaluatee (like conference responses), you need to open the coding editor:

1. Click **Edit Code as Evidence** to open the coding editor
2. **Select** the passage you want to code
3. **Click** the rubric component button
4. Click **Done** to save and return to the normal view

:::tip
You can code multiple passages in a single session. Each coded passage becomes its own evidence item.

## Removing Coding

To remove coding from a text passage:

1. **Place your cursor** in the coded text
2. **Click** the rubric component button (it appears greyed out when you're in a coded region)
3. **Confirm** the removal when prompted

:::warning
Removing coding also removes the associated evidence item from the Evidence View.

## Viewing Coded Text

Coded text appears with a highlighted background and a component label (like "4c"). You can see all coded passages:

- **In the text editor** — Highlighted inline where they appear
- **In Evidence View** — As collected evidence items for each rubric component

## Tips for Effective Text Coding

- **Be selective** — Code passages that clearly demonstrate the rubric component
- **Code specific phrases** — A sentence or two is often more useful than entire paragraphs
- **Review before submitting** — Check that your coded text accurately reflects the evidence you want to capture
