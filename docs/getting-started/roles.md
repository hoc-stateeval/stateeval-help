# Roles in eVAL

Your role in eVAL determines what you can see and do. Some users have a single role; others have multiple roles across different locations.

## Evaluation Roles

These roles participate directly in evaluations — either being evaluated or conducting evaluations.

| Role | Who They Are | What They Do in eVAL |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Teacher** | Classroom teachers | Participate in their own evaluation — submit artifacts, respond to prompts, set student growth goals |
| **Principal** | School principals | Evaluate teachers at their school **and** participate in their own evaluation |
| **Head Principal** | Head principals at schools with multiple principals | Evaluate both teachers and assistant principals, plus participate in their own evaluation |
| **District Teacher Evaluator (DTE)** | District-level staff who evaluate teachers | Evaluate teachers who are assigned at the district level (often specialists serving multiple schools) |
| **District Principal Evaluator (DPE)** | District-level staff who evaluate principals | Evaluate head principals |

:::info Evaluators Are Often Evaluatees Too
A principal evaluates their teachers, but is also being evaluated by a district principal evaluator. When you have both roles, you switch between them using [Work Areas](./work-areas.md).

## Administrative Roles

These roles manage the setup and configuration of evaluations.

| Role | Scope | What They Do |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **District Admin** | Entire district | Select frameworks, configure settings, manage assignments, oversee all evaluations |
| **School Admin** | One school | Manage school-level settings and assignments (where the district allows) |
| **District Assignment Manager** | Entire district | Manage evaluator assignments only (a limited admin role) |
| **District Viewer** | Assigned schools | View evaluation progress in read-only mode for oversight |

## Multiple Roles and Locations

A single person can hold multiple roles across multiple locations. For example:

- A principal at **two schools** has the same work areas at each school
- A person who is a **principal at one school and a district admin** switches between evaluation and admin work areas

Your annual evaluation is tied to your **district**, not a specific school. If you work at multiple schools in the same district, you have one evaluation for the district.

## Finding Your Way

Once you know your role, see [Work Areas](./work-areas.md) to understand how eVAL organizes your tasks based on that role.
