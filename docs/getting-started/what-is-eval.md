# What is eVAL?

eVAL is a web application that supports the annual evaluation of teachers and principals in Washington State school districts.

## Why eVAL Exists

Washington State requires annual evaluations for all certificated teachers and principals under the Teacher/Principal Evaluation Program (TPEP), established by state legislation in 2010. eVAL is a voluntary tool that districts can use to manage this process digitally instead of on paper.

## What eVAL Does

eVAL supports the full evaluation cycle for a school year:

| Phase | What Happens in eVAL |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Setup** | Administrators select frameworks, assign evaluators, and configure settings |
| **Self-Assessment** | Teachers and principals reflect on their practice |
| **Goal Setting** | Teachers set student growth goals |
| **Evidence Collection** | Observations, artifacts, coded notes, and other evidence are gathered throughout the year |
| **Review** | Evidence is aggregated and reviewed across evaluation criteria |
| **Summative Scoring** | Evaluators assign scores and produce the final evaluation report |

## Who Uses eVAL

eVAL serves several types of users:

- **Teachers and Principals** being evaluated — submit evidence, respond to prompts, review feedback
- **Evaluators** (principals, district evaluators) — conduct observations, collect evidence, score evaluations
- **Administrators** — configure settings, manage assignments, oversee evaluation progress
