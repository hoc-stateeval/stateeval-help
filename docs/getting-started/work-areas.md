# Navigating Work Areas

eVAL organizes your work into **Work Areas** based on your role. Each work area provides specific functionality—think of it as a different "view" of the system tailored to a specific task.

## Understanding Work Areas

Your available work areas depend on your role:

| If you are a... | You have these work areas |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| **Teacher** | My Evaluation |
| **Principal** | Evaluate Teachers, My Evaluation |
| **Head Principal** | Evaluate Teachers, Evaluate Principals, My Evaluation |
| **District Principal Evaluator** | Evaluating Principals |
| **District Teacher Evaluator** | Evaluating Teachers |
| **District Admin** | Admin Teacher Evaluations, Admin Principal Evaluations |
| **School Admin** | Admin Teacher Evaluations, Admin Principal Evaluations |

:::tip Multiple Schools
If you work at multiple schools, your evaluator work areas (like Evaluate Teachers) appear at each school. However, since you have only one evaluation per district, the "My Evaluation" work area appears just once — not per school.

## Switching Work Areas

To switch between work areas:

1. Click the **work area selector** in the top navigation bar
2. If you work at multiple locations, first select your **building/location**
3. Choose the **work area** you want to access
4. The sidebar will update to show activities for that work area

## Work Area Types

### Evaluation Work Areas

These work areas are for participating in or conducting evaluations.

#### My Evaluation
For teachers and principals being evaluated. This is where you:
- Complete self-assessments
- Submit artifacts
- View observation feedback
- Track your evaluation progress

#### Evaluate Teachers
For principals and district teacher evaluators. This is where you:
- View your assigned teachers
- Conduct and document observations
- Review teacher artifacts
- Complete teacher evaluations

#### Evaluate Principals
For head principals and district principal evaluators. This is where you:
- View your assigned principals
- Conduct and document observations
- Review principal artifacts
- Complete principal evaluations

### Administrative Work Areas

These work areas are for managing staff and configuring evaluations.

#### Admin Teacher Evaluations
For district and school administrators. This is where you:
- Manage teacher staff records
- Assign evaluators to teachers
- Configure teacher evaluation settings
- View teacher evaluation reports

#### Admin Principal Evaluations
For district and school administrators. This is where you:
- Manage principal staff records
- Assign evaluators to principals
- Configure principal evaluation settings
- View principal evaluation reports

## Special Cases

### One Evaluation Per District

Your annual evaluation is tied to your **district**, not a specific school. If you work at multiple schools within the same district, you have a single "My Evaluation" work area for the district.

### Multiple Roles

Some users have multiple roles. For example:
- A **principal** is both an evaluator (evaluating teachers) and an evaluatee (being evaluated themselves)
- A **head principal** can evaluate both teachers and assistant principals

When you have multiple roles, simply switch work areas to access different functionality.
