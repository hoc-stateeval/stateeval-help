# Navigating Work Areas

eVAL organizes your work into **Work Areas** based on your role. Each work area provides specific functionality—think of it as a different "view" of the system tailored to a specific task.

## Understanding Work Areas

Your available work areas depend on your role:

| If you are a... | You have these work areas |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| **Teacher** | Prepare for My Evaluation |
| **Principal** | Evaluate Teachers, Prepare for My Evaluation |
| **Head Principal** | Evaluate Teachers, Evaluate Principals, Prepare for My Evaluation |
| **District Principal Evaluator** | Evaluating Principals |
| **District Teacher Evaluator** | Evaluating Teachers |
| **District Admin** | Admin Teacher Evaluations, Admin Principal Evaluations |
| **School Admin** | Admin Teacher Evaluations, Admin Principal Evaluations |

:::tip Multiple Schools
If you work at multiple schools with the same role, you'll have the same work areas available at each location. For example, a principal at three schools would see "Evaluate Teachers" and "Prepare for My Evaluation" at each school.

## Switching Work Areas

To switch between work areas:

1. Click the **work area selector** in the top navigation bar
2. If you work at multiple locations, first select your **building/location**
3. Choose the **work area** you want to access
4. The sidebar will update to show activities for that work area

## Work Area Types

### Evaluation Work Areas

These work areas are for participating in or conducting evaluations.

#### Prepare for My Evaluation
For teachers and principals being evaluated. This is where you:
- Complete self-assessments
- Submit artifacts
- View observation feedback
- Track your evaluation progress

#### Evaluate Teachers
For principals and district teacher evaluators. This is where you:
- View your assigned teachers
- Conduct and document observations
- Review teacher artifacts
- Complete teacher evaluations

#### Evaluate Principals
For head principals and district principal evaluators. This is where you:
- View your assigned principals
- Conduct and document observations
- Review principal artifacts
- Complete principal evaluations

### Administrative Work Areas

These work areas are for managing staff and configuring evaluations.

#### Admin Teacher Evaluations
For district and school administrators. This is where you:
- Manage teacher staff records
- Assign evaluators to teachers
- Configure teacher evaluation settings
- View teacher evaluation reports

#### Admin Principal Evaluations
For district and school administrators. This is where you:
- Manage principal staff records
- Assign evaluators to principals
- Configure principal evaluation settings
- View principal evaluation reports

## Special Cases

### One Evaluation Per District

Your annual evaluation is tied to your **district**, not a specific school. If you work at multiple schools within the same district, you'll have only one "Prepare for My Evaluation" work area for the entire district—not one per school.

### Multiple Roles

Some users have multiple roles. For example:
- A **principal** is both an evaluator (evaluating teachers) and an evaluatee (being evaluated themselves)
- A **head principal** can evaluate both teachers and assistant principals

When you have multiple roles, simply switch work areas to access different functionality.
