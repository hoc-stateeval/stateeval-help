# Understanding Your Role in eVAL

Your role in eVAL determines what you can see and do in the system. You may have one or more roles depending on your position.

:::tip Multiple Roles
Many users have multiple roles. For example, a principal is typically both an **evaluator** (evaluating teachers) and an **evaluatee** (being evaluated by district staff). Use the work area selector to switch between your different roles.

## Administrative Roles

Administrative roles manage staff and configure eVAL settings. These users don't participate in evaluations directly.

### District Administrator

**What you can do:**
- Manage all staff across the entire district
- Add, edit, and remove staff members at any school
- Upload district-wide staff rosters
- Assign evaluators to principals and teachers
- Configure district evaluation settings
- View reports across all schools

### District Assignment Manager

**What you can do:**

This is a focused role for users who only need to manage evaluation assignments without full administrative access.

### District Viewer

- Monitor evaluation completion across schools

This is a read-only role for oversight without the ability to make changes.
