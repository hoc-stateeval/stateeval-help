# Email Notifications

eVAL can send email notifications for evaluation workflow events in addition to in-app notifications. Districts configure which notifications are required, and individuals can subscribe to additional notifications based on their preferences.

---

## How Notifications Work

Every evaluation workflow event (observation sent, goals approved, report ready for review, etc.) can trigger:

1. **In-app notification** — Always generated, appears on your dashboard
2. **Email notification** — Optional, based on district requirements and personal preferences

Email notifications supplement in-app notifications — they don't replace them. Users who check their eVAL dashboard regularly may prefer fewer emails, while those who need reminders can enable more.

---

## Two Levels of Configuration

### District Configuration

District Administrators can mark certain notifications as **required**. When a notification is required:

- All users receive that email notification
- Users cannot opt out
- Ensures critical workflow events are never missed

**Common required notifications:**
- Report sent for review (observation, summative)
- Goals submitted for approval
- Unlock request received

**Where:** Settings > Notification Settings

### Individual Preferences

Each user can configure their own notification preferences for events that aren't required by the district.

**Where:** My Account > Notification Preferences

Users can:
- Enable or disable specific notification types
- Choose delivery timing (immediate or batch)

## Delivery Options

| Option | When Emails Are Sent |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Immediate** | As soon as the event occurs |
| **Nightly Batch** | Consolidated into a single daily email sent overnight |

**Nightly batch** reduces inbox clutter by combining multiple notifications into one email. This works well for users who check eVAL daily and don't need real-time alerts.

**Immediate** delivery is better for time-sensitive events where quick response is expected, such as reports awaiting acknowledgment.

:::tip Mix and Match
Consider using immediate delivery for high-priority notifications (reports for review) and nightly batch for informational ones (evidence shared).

## Notification Categories

Notifications are organized by the workflow area they relate to:

| Category | Example Events |
|----------|---------------|
| **Observations** | Observation scheduled, pre-conference sent, report ready for review |
| **Student Growth** | Goals submitted, goals approved, achievement submitted |
| **Summative** | Summative sent for review, summative acknowledged |
| **Evidence** | Artifact shared, coded note shared, YTD evidence added |
| **Administrative** | Assignment changed, plan type changed |

## Best Practices

### For District Administrators

- **Require sparingly** — Only require notifications for events that truly need immediate attention
- **Focus on action items** — Prioritize notifications where someone needs to do something (review, approve, acknowledge)
- **Communicate expectations** — Let staff know which notifications are required and why

### For Evaluators and Evaluatees

- **Start conservative** — Enable fewer notifications initially, add more if you're missing things
- **Prioritize action items** — Focus on notifications that require your response
- **Use batch for informational** — Events like "evidence shared" can often wait for a daily summary
- **Check in-app regularly** — If you check eVAL daily, you may need fewer email notifications

## When to Configure

### District Administrators

Configure notification requirements at the **beginning of the school year** before evaluations begin. This ensures:
- Required notifications are in place from day one
- Staff expectations are set early
- No critical events are missed during the busy start of year

### Evaluators and Evaluatees

Set up your notification preferences **early in the year** as part of getting ready for evaluations:
- Review what the district has required
- Decide which additional notifications you want
- Choose your delivery preference (immediate vs batch)

Revisit your preferences mid-year if you're getting too many emails or missing important events.
