# Understanding Your Evaluation

This page explains the key concepts behind the evaluation process in eVAL.

## What is an Evaluation?

In Washington State, both teachers and principals are required to complete annual evaluations based on standards established by state legislation. eVAL is the software that supports this evaluation process digitally.

An evaluation in eVAL involves:
- Collecting different types of **evidence** throughout the school year
- Aligning that evidence with your district's **instructional framework**
- Receiving a **summative performance rating** at the end of the year

## The Evaluation Process

Throughout the year, you'll participate in various activities that contribute to your evaluation:

| Activity | What It Is | Who Does It |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Self-Assessment** | Reflect on your practice and identify growth areas | Evaluatee |
| **Goal Setting** | Set professional growth goals for the year | Evaluatee |
| **Artifacts** | Submit evidence of your practice (lesson plans, student work, etc.) | Evaluatee |
| **Observations** | Formal classroom/leadership observations | Evaluator |
| **Student Growth** | Document student learning and growth data | Evaluatee |
| **Summative Evaluation** | Final evaluation combining all evidence | Evaluator |

## Evaluation Types

### Teacher Evaluations
For certificated classroom teachers. Your principal (or a district teacher evaluator) conducts your evaluation using a teacher-focused instructional framework.

### Principal Evaluations
For school principals and assistant principals. A district principal evaluator conducts your evaluation using a leadership-focused framework.

## Plan Types: Comprehensive vs. Focused

Your evaluation will be either **Comprehensive** or **Focused**, depending on your situation.

### Comprehensive Evaluation

A comprehensive evaluation assesses **all eight evaluation criteria**. Each criterion contributes to your overall performance rating.

**Who is on a Comprehensive evaluation?**
- New employees
- Employees who received Basic or Unsatisfactory in their last evaluation
- Employees transitioning back from Focused (typically every 4 years)

### Focused Evaluation

A focused evaluation assesses **one criterion** that you select, along with related professional and student growth goals.

**Who is on a Focused evaluation?**
- Employees who received **Proficient** or **Distinguished** on their last Comprehensive evaluation

:::info Score Carry-Forward
When you're on a Focused evaluation, your scores from your last Comprehensive evaluation carry forward. The Focused evaluation lets you dive deeper into one area while maintaining your overall rating.

:::tip Plan Type Changes
If your plan type changes during the year, some evidence may be affected. See [Plan Type Changes](./plan-type-changes.md) to learn how eVAL handles these situations.

## Performance Levels

Your evaluation results in one of four performance levels:

| Level | Rating | What It Means |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| 4 | **Distinguished** | Exceeds standards consistently |
| 3 | **Proficient** | Meets standards effectively |
| 2 | **Basic** | Approaching standards, needs improvement |
| 1 | **Unsatisfactory** | Does not meet standards |

### What Happens Based on Your Rating?

- **Distinguished or Proficient (3-4)**: You may move to a Focused evaluation the following year
- **Basic or Unsatisfactory (1-2)**: You'll remain on or move to a Comprehensive evaluation with additional support

## The Eight Criteria

Washington State evaluations are organized around eight criteria. The specific criteria differ slightly for teachers and principals, but both are evaluated across eight areas aligned with state standards.

Your district's chosen **instructional framework** (such as Danielson, Marzano, or CEL 5D+) provides the detailed rubrics for each criterion.

## Your Evaluation Timeline

A typical evaluation year follows this pattern:

1. **Fall** - Complete self-assessment, set goals
2. **Throughout the year** - Submit artifacts, participate in observations
3. **Mid-year** (if applicable) - Mid-year check-in with your evaluator
4. **Spring** - Final observations, summative evaluation completed
5. **End of year** - Review final evaluation results with your evaluator
