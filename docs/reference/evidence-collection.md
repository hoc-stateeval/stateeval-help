# Evidence Collection

Evidence is at the heart of your evaluation. Throughout the school year, you'll gather and submit various types of evidence that demonstrate your professional practice. Your evaluator reviews this evidence to inform your final evaluation.

## What is an Evidence Collection?

In eVAL, an **Evidence Collection** is a structured container that holds evidence and moves through a defined workflow. Each type of evidence collection has its own rules about:
- Who can create and edit content
- How content is shared between evaluator and evaluatee
- How the collection is finalized (locked/sealed)

Think of evidence collections as organized folders that follow specific processes. Some are simple (you create content and optionally share it), while others have formal review and approval steps.

## Where Evidence Comes From

Evidence in eVAL is collected through several activities. Each activity contributes different types of evidence to your overall evaluation record.

| Activity | What It Contributes | Who Creates It |
|----------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Artifacts** | Documents, links, and narrative text | Evaluatee and Evaluator |
| **Observations** | Observation notes, pre/post conference responses, summary notes | Evaluator (with some input from Evaluatee) |
| **Student Growth** | Goals, progress documentation, achievement evidence | Evaluatee and Evaluator |
| **Self-Assessment** | Reflective responses about your practice | Evaluatee |
| **Coded Notes** | Informal notes coded to evaluation criteria | Evaluator |

## Viewing Your Evidence

### Year-to-Date (YTD) Evidence

The **YTD Evidence** view shows all evidence collected so far this year, aggregated from all your activities. This is your central place to see everything that's been gathered for your evaluation.

Depending on your district's settings, you may also be able to add narrative notes directly to your YTD Evidence collection.

### Summative Evidence View

The **Summative Evaluation** includes a similar aggregated view of all evidence, but it's focused on end-of-year scoring. This is what your evaluator uses when completing your final evaluation.

## Evidence Activities

### Artifacts

Both you and your evaluator can submit artifacts as evidence. Artifacts can be:
- **Documents** - Lesson plans, student work samples, professional development certificates
- **Links** - URLs to external resources, portfolios, or online work
- **Narrative text** - Written descriptions or reflections

[Learn more about working with artifacts](../artifacts/index.md)

### Observations

Your evaluator conducts classroom or leadership observations throughout the year. Evidence from observations includes:
- Observation notes taken during the visit
- Pre-conference discussion notes
- Post-conference discussion notes
- Summary notes and feedback

You can view observation feedback in your evaluation workspace.

### Student Growth Goals

At the beginning of the school year, you create student growth goals. Evidence related to student growth includes:
- Your goal statements
- Progress documentation throughout the year
- End-of-year achievement data
- Related artifacts

### Self-Assessment

Self-assessment is typically completed at the beginning of the school year. It allows you to reflect on your practice and identify growth areas before formal evaluation activities begin.

:::note
Evidence from Self-Assessment is for reflection purposes and is **not** included in your Summative Evaluation report.
:::

### Coded Notes

Evaluators can create informal notes throughout the year and "code" them to specific evaluation criteria. These might include:
- Walkthrough observations
- Informal feedback
- Notes from professional conversations

## How Evidence is Organized

Evidence is organized by your district's **instructional framework** (such as Danielson, Marzano, or CEL 5D+). When evidence is submitted, it can be aligned to specific:
- **Criteria** - The eight evaluation areas
- **Components** - Specific elements within each criterion
- **Indicators** - Detailed descriptors of practice

This alignment helps you and your evaluator see how evidence supports ratings across all evaluation criteria.

## Tips for Building Strong Evidence

1. **Submit evidence throughout the year** - Don't wait until the end. Regular submissions show growth over time.

2. **Align evidence to criteria** - When submitting artifacts, connect them to specific evaluation criteria to show their relevance.

3. **Include variety** - Different types of evidence (documents, reflections, student data) provide a fuller picture of your practice.

4. **Add context** - When submitting artifacts, include descriptions that explain what the evidence shows and why it's significant.

5. **Review regularly** - Check your YTD Evidence periodically to ensure you have evidence across all relevant criteria.
