# Evidence Collections

In eVAL, each evaluation activity — an observation, an artifact, a student growth goal, a self-assessment, or a coded note — creates an **evidence collection**. An evidence collection is a container that holds the evidence produced by that activity and controls who can see it and when.

## How Evidence Collections Work

Each evidence collection has:

- **A type** — determined by the activity (observation, artifact, student growth, self-assessment, coded note)
- **A scope** — which rubric criteria and components the evidence can be aligned to, based on the evaluatee's plan type
- **A workflow** — rules for how the collection moves from draft to final, who can edit, and when it becomes visible to others

See [How Workflows Work](./workflows.md) for the detailed lifecycle of each type.

## Tabs and Visibility

Most evidence collections have multiple tabs. Some tabs are visible to both parties from the start, while others are initially visible only to the evaluator and can be shared later.

### Common Pattern

| Tab Type | Visible To | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Setup / Configuration** | Both parties | Often read-only for one party |
| **Content tabs** (prompts, responses, goals) | Both parties | Each party sees their own view/data |
| **Evidence View** | Evaluator only until shared | Where evidence is reviewed, packaged, and scored |
| **Report** | Evaluator only until shared | Shows the evolving report with scores |

The evaluator can choose to share the Evidence View and Report tabs at any time before submission. Once the evidence collection is submitted, these tabs become visible automatically.

### Why This Matters

The Evidence View and Report tabs are where scoring happens. Keeping them private until shared allows the evaluator to work on scoring without the evaluatee seeing incomplete or draft scores. When ready, the evaluator either:
- **Shares early** — Makes the tabs visible before submission
- **Submits** — Tabs become visible automatically as part of submission

### Student Growth Exception

Student Growth is evaluatee-initiated. The evaluatee creates goals first and has the option to share their Goal Setting screen with the evaluator before submission. The evaluator still has private Evidence View and Report tabs that follow the same sharing pattern.

## When Evidence Becomes Public

Once an evidence collection is **submitted**, its evidence becomes **public** — meaning it flows to and is visible in:

- **YTD Evidence** — The year-to-date view showing all published evidence
- **Summative Evidence** — The end-of-year view filtered to the evaluatee's plan type scope

| Evidence Collection | Submitted When... | Evidence Then Visible In |
|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|
| **Observation** | Evaluator submits/locks | YTD and Summative |
| **Coded Note** | Evaluator shares | YTD and Summative |
| **Student Growth** | Goals/achievement approved | YTD and Summative |
| **Artifact** | Creator shares | YTD and Summative |
| **Self-Assessment** | Evaluatee shares | YTD only (not Summative) |

:::info Why Can't I See Evidence?
If evidence you expect isn't showing in YTD or Summative, the source evidence collection likely hasn't been submitted yet. Check the workflow state of the source activity.

## Observation Conferences

Observations include pre-conference and post-conference tabs where the evaluator and evaluatee exchange information:

1. **Evaluator selects prompts** — Chooses from the prompt bank and sends to the evaluatee
2. **Evaluatee responds** — Reviews the prompts, writes responses, then shares them with the evaluator
3. **Evaluator reviews and codes** — Reviews responses and optionally "codes" them by selecting sections of text and aligning them to rubric components as evidence

## How Evidence Is Organized

Evidence is organized by your district's **instructional framework** (such as Danielson, Marzano, or CEL 5D+). Within an evidence collection, evidence can be aligned to:

| Level | What It Is |
|-------|-----------|
| **Criterion** | One of the eight state evaluation areas (e.g., C1 through C8) |
| **Component** | A specific element within a criterion |
| **Indicator** | A detailed descriptor of practice within a component |

This alignment is what makes it possible for YTD and Summative views to aggregate evidence from many different collections and show it organized by rubric component.
