# Evidence Collections

In eVAL, each evaluation activity — an observation, an artifact, a student growth goal, a self-assessment, or a coded note — creates an **evidence collection**. An evidence collection is a container that holds the evidence produced by that activity and controls who can see it and when.

## How Evidence Collections Work

Each evidence collection has:

- **A type** — determined by the activity (observation, artifact, student growth, self-assessment, coded note)
- **A scope** — which rubric criteria and components the evidence can be aligned to, based on the evaluatee's plan type
- **A workflow** — rules for how the collection moves from draft to final, who can edit, and when it becomes visible to others

See [How Workflows Work](./workflows.md) for the detailed lifecycle of each type.

## Privacy and Visibility

Evidence starts **private** within its collection and becomes visible to others at specific workflow points:

| Evidence Collection | Private Until... | Then Visible To |
|-------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Observation** | Evaluator submits/locks the observation | Both parties; evidence flows to YTD and Summative |
| **Artifact** | Creator shares the artifact | Both parties; evidence flows to YTD and Summative |
| **Student Growth** | Goals are shared/approved | Both parties; evidence flows to YTD and Summative |
| **Self-Assessment** | Evaluatee shares with evaluator | Both parties; visible in YTD only (not Summative) |
| **Coded Note** | Evaluator shares the note | Both parties; evidence flows to YTD and Summative |
| **YTD Evidence** | Always visible | Both parties immediately |

:::info Why Can't I See Something?
If evidence you expect to see isn't showing up in the YTD or Summative view, the most common reason is that the evidence collection hasn't been shared or locked yet. Check the workflow state of the source activity.

### Evaluator-Only Areas

Within some evidence collections, the evaluator has areas that remain private even after the collection is shared:

- **Scoring** — Performance level scores assigned in the Evidence View are private to the evaluator until the collection's report is shared or submitted
- **Evidence View tabs** — In observations, the evaluator's Evidence View work is not visible to the evaluatee until the observation is submitted

## How Evidence Is Organized

Evidence is organized by your district's **instructional framework** (such as Danielson, Marzano, or CEL 5D+). Within an evidence collection, evidence can be aligned to:

| Level | What It Is |
|-------|-----------|
| **Criterion** | One of the eight state evaluation areas (e.g., C1 through C8) |
| **Component** | A specific element within a criterion |
| **Indicator** | A detailed descriptor of practice within a component |

This alignment is what makes it possible for YTD and Summative views to aggregate evidence from many different collections and show it organized by rubric component.

## Where Evidence Ends Up

Evidence from individual collections flows into two aggregated views:

| View | What It Shows | Used For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **YTD Evidence** | All published evidence across the full rubric, regardless of plan type | Running view of everything gathered so far |
| **Summative Evidence** | Published evidence filtered to the evaluatee's plan type scope | End-of-year scoring by the evaluator |
