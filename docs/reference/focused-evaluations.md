# Focused Evaluations

Each evaluatee is assigned either a **Comprehensive** or **Focused** evaluation for the year. A comprehensive evaluation assesses all eight state criteria. A focused evaluation concentrates on a single criterion, allowing the evaluatee to go deeper in one area.

## Who Qualifies

An evaluatee may be placed on a focused evaluation if they received **Proficient** or **Distinguished** on their most recent comprehensive evaluation. Evaluatees who are new, provisional, or received Basic or Unsatisfactory must be on a comprehensive evaluation.

Focused evaluations are governed by Washington State requirements. For the official rules, see:

- [RCW 28A.405.100](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=28A.405.100) — Certificated employee evaluation law
- [WAC 392-191A-120](https://app.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=392-191A-120) — Focused evaluation standards for teachers
- [WAC 392-191A-190](https://app.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=392-191A-190) — Focused evaluation standards for principals

:::info Comprehensive Frequency
A comprehensive evaluation must occur at least once every six years, even for evaluatees who continue to qualify for focused evaluations.

## Configuring a Focused Evaluation

When an administrator assigns an evaluatee to a focused evaluation, there are two steps:

### 1. Select the Focus Criterion and Student Growth Criterion

The administrator selects one criterion as the focus for the year. If the selected criterion is **not** a student growth criterion, an additional student growth criterion must also be selected.

**For teachers:**
- If criterion 3, 6, or 8 is selected, those student growth rubrics are used
- If another criterion is selected, the student growth rubrics from criterion 3 or 6 are also included

**For principals:**
- If criterion 3, 5, or 8 is selected, those student growth rubrics are used
- If another criterion is selected, the student growth rubrics from criterion 3, 5, or 8 are also included

### 2. Select the Carry-Forward Score

The summative score for a focused evaluation is carried forward from the evaluatee's most recent comprehensive evaluation. eVAL helps you find and select the prior comprehensive evaluation to use.

If the district is new to eVAL or the prior evaluation is not in the system, the carry-forward performance level can be entered manually.

## How Scoring Works

By default, focused evaluations are **not scored at the rubric component level** in eVAL. The summative score is simply the carry-forward score from the last comprehensive evaluation.

This is intentional — it encourages evaluatees to focus on an area that would benefit from attention without the concern that it might lower their performance rating.

There is one exception to the carry-forward rule: if the evaluatee demonstrates exemplary practice on their focus criterion, the evaluator may upgrade the performance level from **Proficient to Distinguished**. This is the only scoring change allowed.

:::note District Setting for Rubric Scoring
Some districts have contractual obligations that require rubric scoring for focused evaluations. If your district has enabled this, the evaluator can score rubric components in the summative evaluation. This is controlled by a district setting — contact your District Admin if you have questions about your district's configuration.

## Impact on Evidence Collections

A focused evaluation affects the scope of evidence collections created during the year:

- **Default scope** — Evidence collections are scoped to the focus criterion and student growth rubric components
- **Expanding scope** — An evidence collection can be expanded to comprehensive scope outside the summative. This is common for self-assessments at the beginning of the year, where the evaluatee may want to reflect across all criteria
- **Summative scope** — The Summative evaluation only includes evidence aligned to the focus criterion and student growth components

:::info YTD vs. Summative
The YTD Evidence view always shows evidence across the full rubric regardless of plan type. Only the Summative Evidence view is filtered to the focused scope.
:::

## Switching Between Focused and Comprehensive

An evaluator may determine that an evaluatee on a focused evaluation should be moved to a comprehensive evaluation. Per state requirements, this decision must be communicated in writing by December 15th.

If the plan type changes mid-year, see [Plan Type Changes](./plan-type-changes.md) for how eVAL handles existing evidence.
