# When Your Plan Type Changes

Your summative evaluation is either **Comprehensive** (all eight criteria) or **Focused** (selected criteria). Sometimes this plan type needs to change during the school year. When it does, eVAL helps ensure your evidence stays properly organized.

## How Plan Type Affects Evidence

When you create evidence (observations, coded notes, artifacts, etc.), it's associated with the plan type that was active at the time. This determines which rubric components the evidence can be aligned to.

- **Comprehensive**: Evidence can align to all eight criteria and their components
- **Focused**: Evidence aligns only to the selected criteria/components

## What Happens When Your Plan Type Changes

When an evaluator changes the summative plan type, eVAL checks each evidence collection to determine if it can be automatically updated:

- **Draft artifacts** - Automatically updated to match the new plan type (rubric alignments adjust to new scope)
- **Empty draft collections** - Automatically updated to match the new plan type
- **Draft collections with evidence** (observations, coded notes, etc.) - Cannot be auto-updated (would hide existing evidence), so you'll see a notification
- **Locked collections** - Cannot be updated, so you'll see a notification

### Evidence Outside Summative Focus

When a locked evidence collection's focus doesn't match the current summative focus, you'll see a notification in the status bar:

**"Evidence outside summative focus"**

Clicking this button reveals more details, showing:
- The **Summative Focus** - the current criteria/components being evaluated
- The **Local Focus** - the criteria/components this evidence collection was created with

### Where This Evidence Appears

Evidence that's outside the summative focus is **not lost**. It will:

| Location | Included? |
|----------|-----------|
| Evidence collection's own Evidence View | Yes |
| Evidence collection's own Report | Yes |
| Summative Evidence View | No |
| Summative Report | No |

This means your observation notes, artifacts, and other evidence remain accessible in their original context - they just won't appear in the final summative evaluation.

## Common Scenarios

### Focused to Comprehensive

If your plan type expands from Focused to Comprehensive, this typically doesn't cause issues. Evidence aligned to your focused criteria is still valid for the comprehensive evaluation.

### Comprehensive to Focused

If your plan type narrows from Comprehensive to Focused, evidence aligned to criteria outside your new focus won't appear in the summative. The evidence remains in its original evidence collection.

### Focused to Different Focused Criteria

If you're on a Focused evaluation and the selected criteria change, evidence aligned to the old criteria won't appear in the summative. This is the most common scenario where you'll see the "Evidence outside summative focus" notification.

## What You Can Do

### For Locked Evidence Collections

When you see the notification on a locked evidence collection, you have a few options:

1. **Leave it as historical evidence** - The evidence remains in the evidence collection's report for your records, even if it's not included in the summative.

2. **Request an unlock** - If the evidence collection supports unlock requests, you can ask your evaluator to unlock it so you can make adjustments.

### For Draft Evidence Collections With Evidence

If a draft evidence collection has existing evidence and the plan type changes, you'll see the same notification. Your options are:

1. **Leave it as-is** - The evidence remains accessible in the evidence collection but won't appear in the summative.

2. **Manually adjust** - Since the collection is still in draft, you can edit or remove evidence as needed.

## Tips

- **Check your evidence collections** after a plan type change to see if any show the "Evidence outside summative focus" notification
- **Review the details** to understand exactly which components are affected
- **Communicate with your evaluator** if you have questions about how the change affects your evaluation
