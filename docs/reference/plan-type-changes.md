# When Your Plan Type Changes

Your summative evaluation is either **Comprehensive** (all eight criteria) or **Focused** (selected criteria). Sometimes this plan type needs to change during the school year. When it does, eVAL helps ensure your evidence stays properly organized.

## How Plan Type Affects Evidence

When you create evidence (observations, coded notes, artifacts, etc.), it's associated with the plan type that was active at the time. This determines which rubric components the evidence can be aligned to.

- **Comprehensive**: Evidence can align to all eight criteria and their components
- **Focused**: Evidence aligns only to the selected criteria/components

## What Happens When Your Plan Type Changes

When an evaluator changes the summative plan type, eVAL automatically updates evidence collections that are still in draft (not yet locked). This keeps your evidence in sync with the new plan type.

However, evidence collections that have already been **locked** (completed) cannot be automatically updated. In these cases, eVAL notifies you so you can decide what to do.

### Evidence Outside Summative Focus

When a locked evidence collection's focus doesn't match the current summative focus, you'll see a notification in the status bar:

**"Evidence outside summative focus"**

Clicking this button reveals more details, showing:
- The **Summative Focus** - the current criteria/components being evaluated
- The **Local Focus** - the criteria/components this evidence collection was created with

### Where This Evidence Appears

Evidence that's outside the summative focus is **not lost**. It will:

| Location | Included? |
|----------|-----------|
| Evidence collection's own Evidence View | Yes |
| Evidence collection's own Report | Yes |
| Summative Evidence View | No |
| Summative Report | No |

This means your observation notes, artifacts, and other evidence remain accessible in their original context - they just won't appear in the final summative evaluation.

## Common Scenarios

### Focused to Comprehensive

If your plan type expands from Focused to Comprehensive, this typically doesn't cause issues. Evidence aligned to your focused criteria is still valid for the comprehensive evaluation.

### Comprehensive to Focused

If your plan type narrows from Comprehensive to Focused, evidence aligned to criteria outside your new focus won't appear in the summative. The evidence remains in its original evidence collection.

### Focused to Different Focused Criteria

If you're on a Focused evaluation and the selected criteria change, evidence aligned to the old criteria won't appear in the summative. This is the most common scenario where you'll see the "Evidence outside summative focus" notification.

## What You Can Do

### For Locked Evidence Collections

When you see the notification on a locked evidence collection, you have a few options:

1. **Leave it as historical evidence** - The evidence remains in the evidence collection's report for your records, even if it's not included in the summative.

2. **Request an unlock** - If the evidence collection supports unlock requests, you can ask your evaluator to unlock it so you can make adjustments.

### For Draft Evidence Collections

Draft evidence collections are automatically updated when the plan type changes. No action is needed on your part.

## Tips

- **Check your evidence collections** after a plan type change to see if any show the "Evidence outside summative focus" notification
- **Review the details** to understand exactly which components are affected
- **Communicate with your evaluator** if you have questions about how the change affects your evaluation
