# Scoring in eVAL

Scoring in eVAL happens at two levels: optional scoring during evidence collection and required scoring in the Summative evaluation. This page explains when scoring is available and how the final evaluation score is calculated.

## Optional Scoring During Evidence Collection

During the year, evaluators and evaluatees can optionally assign performance levels to rubric components. This scoring is **informational** — it helps track progress but doesn't directly determine the final score.

### Where Optional Scoring Is Available

| Evidence Type | Who Scores | Controlled By |
|--------------|------------|---------------|
| **Observations** | Evaluator | Allow Observation Scoring setting |
| **Coded Notes** | Evaluator | Allow Coded Notes Scoring setting |
| **Self-Assessments** | Evaluatee | Allow Self-Assessment Scoring setting |

District Administrators configure these settings. When a setting is disabled, the scoring interface doesn't appear for that evidence type.

### How Optional Scoring Works

When scoring is enabled, the Rubric Navigator's Performance tab shows performance level buttons (Unsatisfactory, Basic, Proficient, Distinguished) for each component. Click a level to record your assessment.

:::tip Scoring Is Optional
Even when enabled, you're not required to score every component. Use scoring when it's helpful for tracking progress or preparing for conferences.

## Summative Scoring (Required)

The Summative evaluation requires scoring and produces the official performance rating. This is where the final evaluation scores are recorded.

### What Gets Scored

Summative scoring uses the **state criteria view** (C1–C8), not the framework domains:

| Criteria | What It Covers |
|----------|---------------|
| C1 | Centering instruction on high expectations |
| C2 | Demonstrating effective teaching practices |
| C3 | Recognizing individual student learning needs |
| C4 | Providing clear and intentional instruction |
| C5 | Using assessment effectively |
| C6 | Creating a positive classroom environment |
| C7 | Communicating and collaborating with families |
| C8 | Exhibiting professionalism |

Each criterion receives a score of 1–4:

| Score | Performance Level |
|-------|-------------------|
| 1 | Unsatisfactory |
| 2 | Basic |
| 3 | Proficient |
| 4 | Distinguished |

### Comprehensive vs. Focused Evaluations

| Plan Type | Criteria Scored | Student Growth Scored |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Comprehensive** | All 8 criteria (C1–C8) | All SG components |
| **Focused** | One criterion (evaluatee's choice) | Only SG components for the chosen criterion |

:::note Focused Evaluation Scoring
In a Focused evaluation, only the selected criterion is scored this year. The other seven criteria retain their scores from the evaluatee's last Comprehensive evaluation.

For Student Growth, only the components related to the chosen criterion are scored. For example, if a teacher selects C3 as their focus, they would score SG 3.1 and SG 3.2 (the C3-related Student Growth components).

## Student Growth Scoring

Student Growth is scored separately from the criteria and affects the final rating through the **Student Growth Impact Rating**.

### Student Growth Components

**For Teachers:**

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| SG 3.1 | Establishing student growth goal(s) |
| SG 3.2 | Achieving student growth goal(s) |
| SG 6.1 | Establishing student growth goal(s) using multiple measures |
| SG 6.2 | Achieving student growth goal(s) using multiple measures |
| SG 8.1 | Establishing and achieving student growth goal(s) collaboratively |

**For Principals:**

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| SG 3 | Ensuring school improvement goals |
| SG 5 | Leading school improvement efforts |
| SG 8 | Engaging the community in improving student learning |

Each component is scored 1–4 (same scale as criteria).

### Student Growth Impact Rating

The Student Growth Impact Rating is calculated from the sum of all Student Growth component scores:

**Teacher Calculations (5 components, range 5–20):**

| Sum of Scores | Impact Rating |
|--------------|---------------|
| 5–12 | LOW |
| 13–17 | AVERAGE |
| 18–20 | HIGH |

**Principal Calculations (3 components, range 3–12):**

| Sum of Scores | Impact Rating |
|--------------|---------------|
| 3–5 | LOW |
| 6–9 | AVERAGE |
| 10–12 | HIGH |

:::warning Automatic LOW Rating
If **any** Student Growth component receives a score of 1, the Impact Rating is automatically LOW, regardless of the total sum.
:::

---

## Final Score Calculation

The final Summative score combines the criteria scores and the Student Growth Impact Rating.

### Step 1: Calculate Criteria Score

Sum the scores for all 8 criteria (C1–C8):

| Sum of C1–C8 | Criteria Performance Level |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| 8–14 | Unsatisfactory |
| 15–21 | Basic |
| 22–28 | Proficient |
| 29–32 | Distinguished |

### Step 2: Apply Student Growth Impact

The Student Growth Impact Rating can lower the final score:

| Criteria Level | Impact Rating | Final Score |
|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| Distinguished | HIGH or AVERAGE | Distinguished |
| Distinguished | LOW | **Proficient** (lowered) |
| Proficient | Any | Proficient |
| Basic | Any | Basic |
| Unsatisfactory | Any | Unsatisfactory |

:::info Impact of Student Growth
Student Growth can only lower a Distinguished rating to Proficient. It cannot raise or lower any other performance level.
:::

### Step 3: Record Final Rating

The final Summative performance level becomes the official evaluation rating for the year. This rating determines:
- Whether the evaluatee qualifies for Focused evaluation next year
- The evaluatee's official employment record
- Any required improvement plans

## Scoring Settings Reference

District Administrators configure scoring through module settings:

| Setting | Module | Effect |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Allow Rubric Scoring | Observations | Enables/disables scoring in observations |
| Allow Rubric Scoring | Coded Notes | Enables/disables scoring in coded notes |
| Allow Rubric Scoring | Self Assessments | Enables/disables scoring in self-assessments |
| Allow Focused Rubric Component Scoring | Summative | Enables/disables component scoring in Focused evaluations |

See [Modules and Settings](./modules-settings.md) for the complete list.
