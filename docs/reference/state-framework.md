# Washington State Evaluation Framework

Washington State requires annual evaluations for teachers and principals based on standards established by state legislation (E2SSB 6696). This page explains how the evaluation framework is structured and how it appears in eVAL.

## The Eight State Criteria

Washington State defines **eight evaluation criteria** (commonly called "the State Eight" or C1-C8) that form the foundation of all evaluations. There are separate criteria sets for teachers and principals, though both follow the same eight-criterion structure.

### Teacher Criteria (C1-C8)

| Criterion | Focus Area |
|-----------|------------|
| C1 | Centering instruction on high expectations for student achievement |
| C2 | Demonstrating effective teaching practices |
| C3 | Recognizing individual student learning needs and developing strategies to address those needs |
| C4 | Providing clear and intentional focus on subject matter content and curriculum |
| C5 | Fostering and managing a safe, positive learning environment |
| C6 | Using multiple student data elements to modify instruction and improve student learning |
| C7 | Communicating and collaborating with parents and the school community |
| C8 | Exhibiting collaborative and collegial practices focused on improving instructional practice and student learning |

### Principal Criteria (C1-C8)

| Criterion | Focus Area |
|-----------|------------|
| C1 | Creating a school culture that promotes the ongoing improvement of learning and teaching |
| C2 | Providing for school safety |
| C3 | Leading the development, implementation, and evaluation of a data-driven plan for increasing student achievement |
| C4 | Assisting instructional staff with alignment of curriculum, instruction, and assessment with state and local learning goals |
| C5 | Monitoring, assisting, and evaluating effective instruction and assessment practices |
| C6 | Managing both staff and fiscal resources to support student achievement and legal responsibilities |
| C7 | Partnering with the school community to promote student learning |
| C8 | Demonstrating commitment to closing the achievement gap |

## Instructional Frameworks

Your district uses an **instructional framework** to provide detailed rubrics for evaluation. An instructional framework is a comprehensive set of rubrics organized into domains that describe best practices for teaching or leadership.

### Supported Teacher Frameworks

eVAL supports these instructional frameworks for teacher evaluations:

- **Danielson Framework for Teaching** - Organized into four domains (Planning & Preparation, Learning Environments, Instruction, Professional Responsibilities)
- **CEL 5D+ Teacher Evaluation Rubric** - Developed by the Center for Educational Leadership
- **Marzano New Art of Science and Teaching** - Research-based framework focused on effective instruction

### Supported Principal Frameworks

eVAL supports these frameworks for principal evaluations:

- **AWSP Leadership Framework** - Developed by the Association of Washington School Principals specifically for Washington State
- **Marzano School Leader Evaluation Model** - Leadership-focused evaluation framework

## How Frameworks Connect to State Criteria

Each instructional framework organizes its rubrics differently (into "domains" or other groupings), but all frameworks map their components to Washington's eight state criteria.

For example, in the Danielson Framework:
- Domain 1 (Planning and Preparation) maps primarily to **C4**
- Domain 2 (Learning Environments) maps primarily to **C5**
- Domain 3 (Instruction) maps to **C1, C2, C3, C6**
- Domain 4 (Professional Responsibilities) maps to **C6, C7, C8**

:::tip Viewing Options
In eVAL, you can view evidence and rubrics organized by either your **instructional framework's domains** or by the **state criteria (C1-C8)**. Your district administrator sets the default view, but you can switch between views as needed.

## Student Growth

Student growth is a required component of Washington State evaluations. It measures the change in student achievement between two points in time.

### For Teachers

Teachers have student growth components tied to three criteria:

| Criterion | Student Growth Components |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| C3 | SG 3.1 - Establish Student Growth Goal(s)<br/>SG 3.2 - Achievement of Student Growth Goal(s) |
| C6 | SG 6.1 - Establish Student Growth Goal(s)<br/>SG 6.2 - Achievement of Student Growth Goal(s) |
| C8 | SG 8.1 - Establish Team Student Growth Goal(s) |

Teachers create student growth goals at the beginning of the year and then document achievement of those goals throughout the year.

### For Principals

Principals have student growth components tied to three criteria:

| Criterion | Student Growth Component |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| C3 | Evidence of student growth from school improvement planning |
| C5 | Evidence of student growth of selected teachers |
| C8 | Evidence of growth in student learning |

Principal student growth focuses on results from school improvement planning rather than individual goal-setting.

### Student Growth Impact Rating

Your student growth performance contributes to your overall evaluation through the **Student Growth Impact Rating**, which can be:

- **Low** - May lower a Distinguished rating to Proficient
- **Average** - No adjustment to your overall rating
- **High** - Reflects strong student growth performance

:::warning Important
A score of "1" (Unsatisfactory) on any student growth component results in an automatic **Low** impact rating, which can affect your final summative score.
:::

## Comprehensive vs. Focused Evaluations

### Comprehensive Evaluation

A comprehensive evaluation assesses **all eight criteria**. You're on a comprehensive evaluation if:
- You're new to the district
- You received Basic or Unsatisfactory on your last evaluation
- It's been six years since your last comprehensive evaluation

### Focused Evaluation

A focused evaluation assesses **one criterion** you select, plus related student growth activities. You're eligible for a focused evaluation if:
- You received Proficient or Distinguished on your last comprehensive evaluation
- You're not due for your six-year comprehensive cycle

When on a focused evaluation, your scores from your last comprehensive evaluation carry forward while you dive deeper into your selected focus area.

## Performance Levels

All rubric components are scored on a four-level scale:

| Level | Rating | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 4 | Distinguished | Exceeds standards consistently |
| 3 | Proficient | Meets standards effectively |
| 2 | Basic | Approaching standards, needs improvement |
| 1 | Unsatisfactory | Does not meet standards |

Your final summative rating is calculated from your scores across all eight criteria (comprehensive) or your focus criterion plus carried-forward scores (focused).
