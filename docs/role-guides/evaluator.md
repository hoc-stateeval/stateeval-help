# Evaluator Guide

As an evaluator (Principal, DPE, or DTE), you conduct observations, collect evidence, and complete evaluations for staff assigned to you.

## Your Evaluation Year

| Phase | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| **Fall** | Review self-assessments, approve student growth goals |
| **Throughout Year** | Conduct observations, collect evidence, add coded notes |
| **Mid-Year** | Complete mid-year reviews (if enabled) |
| **Spring** | Final observations, complete summative evaluations |

## Setting Up Your Prompt Bank

**Where:** Prompt Bank

You can pre-define your own prompts for use during evaluations. These prompts are available only to you, in addition to any district or school prompts.

| Prompt Type | Used When |
|-------------|-----------|
| Pre-Conference | Setting up observation conferences |
| Post-Conference | Observation post-conference reflections |
| Student Growth | Goal-setting and achievement discussions |
| Summative Reflection | End-of-year evaluation discussions |

:::tip Start of Year
Consider setting up your prompts at the beginning of the year so they're ready when you start observations.

## Key Concepts

### How Workflows Affect You
Understanding [How Workflows Work](../reference/workflows) is essential:
- **Observations** move through Draft → Locked states
- **Student Growth** requires your approval before sealing
- **Summative Evaluations** require evaluatee acknowledgment (usually)

### Simple vs. Formal Completion
Your district configures whether evaluations use [Simple or Formal workflow](../reference/workflows#completion-modes-simple-vs-formal):
- **Simple**: You complete directly, evaluatee is notified
- **Formal**: Evaluatee must review and acknowledge before sealing

### What You Inherit
The settings you see (prompts, modules, resources) depend on your position in the hierarchy. See [How Settings Are Inherited](../reference/settings-inheritance) - particularly important if you're a DTE/DPE, as school-level settings are bypassed.

## Evidence You Create

| Type | Purpose | Workflow |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Observations** | Formal classroom/leadership observations | Locking workflow with review |
| **Coded Notes** | Informal notes linked to rubric criteria | Share-only, can delete anytime |
| **YTD Evidence** | Collaborative evidence notes | Always open, no approval |

See [Workflows](../reference/workflows#detailed-workflows) for details on each.

## Common Questions

**Why can't I edit an observation?**
Once locked, observations require an unlock request approved by the evaluatee. See [Unlock Requests](../reference/workflows#unlock-requests).

**What's the difference between Coded Notes and YTD Evidence?**
Coded Notes are yours - private until you share, deletable anytime. YTD Evidence is collaborative - immediately visible to both parties. Use Coded Notes for working notes; YTD Evidence for shared documentation.

**Can I change an evaluatee's plan type?**
Yes, in the Summative section while it's in Draft. If observations/artifacts were created with the old plan type, check your district's "Keep Plan Type in Sync" setting - see [Modules and Settings](../reference/modules-settings#artifacts-module-settings).

**Do I need to wait for the evaluatee to acknowledge?**
Depends on your district's workflow settings. See [Completion Modes](../reference/workflows#completion-modes-simple-vs-formal).
