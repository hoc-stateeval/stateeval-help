# Teacher Guide

As a teacher in eVAL, you participate in your annual evaluation by providing evidence of your practice and engaging with feedback from your evaluator.

## Your Evaluation Year

| Phase | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| **Fall** | Complete self-assessment, set student growth goals |
| **Throughout Year** | Submit artifacts, participate in observations |
| **Mid-Year** | Review mid-year feedback (if your district uses this) |
| **Spring** | Final observations, review summative evaluation |

## Key Concepts

Before diving in, understand these concepts that affect your experience:

### How Evidence Works
Your evaluation is built on evidence collected throughout the year. See [Evidence Collection](../reference/evidence-collection) to understand what counts and how it's organized.

### Why You Can't Edit Some Things
Evidence collections move through workflows with specific states. If you can't edit something, it's likely been shared or locked. See [How Workflows Work](../reference/workflows) to understand:
- Why self-assessments can't be changed once shared
- How observation feedback becomes finalized
- When your evaluator needs to unlock something for you

### Comprehensive vs. Focused
Your evaluation is either **Comprehensive** (all 8 criteria) or **Focused** (one criterion you select). See [Understanding Your Evaluation](../reference/evaluation-basics#plan-types-comprehensive-vs-focused) for how this affects your year.

## Common Questions

**Why can't I edit my self-assessment?**
Once you share a self-assessment with your evaluator, it's permanently locked. This is by design - see [Self-Assessment Workflow](../reference/workflows#detailed-workflows).

**When will I see my observation feedback?**
After your evaluator sends the Final Report. Depending on your district's settings, you may need to acknowledge it before it's sealed. See [Observation Workflow](../reference/workflows#detailed-workflows).

**What artifacts should I submit?**
Anything that demonstrates your practice: lesson plans, student work, professional development, parent communication. Quality over quantity - include context explaining what the evidence shows.

**How do I know what's expected of me?**
Your evaluation is based on your district's instructional framework (like Danielson or CEL 5D+). See [State Framework](../reference/state-framework) for how frameworks connect to Washington's eight criteria.
