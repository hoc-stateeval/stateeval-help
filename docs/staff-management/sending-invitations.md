# Sending Account Invitations

Staff members need to activate their accounts before they can log in. You send invitations from the Invitations tab in Staff Admin.

## Viewing Pending Invitations

1. Go to **Staff Admin** > **Invitations**
2. You'll see staff members who:
   - **Need Account Setup** - Have never been sent an invitation
   - **Invited** - Were sent an invitation but haven't activated yet

## Sending an Invitation

1. Find the staff member in the Invitations list
2. Click the **Send** (envelope) icon
3. The staff member will receive an email with an activation link

## Resending an Invitation

If a staff member didn't receive or lost their invitation:

1. Find them in the Invitations list (status: Invited)
2. Click the **Resend** icon
3. A new invitation email will be sent

## What Staff Members Receive

The invitation email includes:
- A link to activate their account
- Instructions to create their password
- The link expires after a set period (contact your administrator for details)

## Troubleshooting

**Staff member says they didn't receive the email:**
- Check that the email address is correct
- Ask them to check their spam/junk folder
- Resend the invitation

**Invitation link expired:**
- Simply resend the invitation to generate a new link
